    <h1>It is the year 2021.</h1>
    <h2>Rick Astley has taken over the universe and is singing "Never Gonna Give You Up" endlessly and constantly, without end.</h2>
    <h2>However, Rick Astley promises to stop if someone survives an epically hard boss fight, to the tune of Rick's very favorite song.</h2>
    <h2>Can you save the universe from Rick Astley's endless singing? Or will the rick rolls go on forever?</h2>
    <h3>How to play: Use arrow keys or WASD to move. You can play a normal game with 3 lives, or a hardcore game with 1 life.</h3>

    <!-- If you're looking at the code - yes I know this isn't the most efficient way to implement multiple lives but I'm too lazy -->
